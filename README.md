# Anomaly based Resilient Network Intrusion Detection using Inferential Autoencoders

The conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) is an extension of variational auto encoder. This means that there is still probabilistic distribution in latent space  as in VAE. We know that VAE only models normal traffic in single normal distribution but can we model normal traffic in one distribution and malicious traffic in other distribution in latent space .Hence the idea of CVAE was proposed. Originally CVAE were created so one could control  data generation. Just like any other autoencoder it also has encoder and decoder part. Encoder is used for encoding information in latent space while decoder decodes from latent to input space. We want to design such autoencoder which define normal traffic in separate latent space while malicious traffic in latent space. Hence a semi supervised technique. The intuition behind this is that it will capture different features according to the class whom data is being associated in altent domain and hence will store these feature in different distributions.

Results for the evaluation are present in ./src/py_files
